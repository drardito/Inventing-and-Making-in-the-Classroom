#Project Ideas Using Scratch
These project ideas were generated during the STEM-D Course: Inventing and Making in the Classroom held at Pace University during the Summer of 2014

##From Aida and Jasmine
*Vocabulary* –
     Virtual house or classroom or world with clickable items that show and pronounce English names of items and allows student to write the item name in their language.
           
*Hangman* – 
  Vocabulary sets are inputted and student plays hangman.  When each letter is pressed the sound or name of the letter is said.  Can be adapted for any set of vocabulary words.
 
*Sequencing* –
   Scene where items are interactive that show and say the items name.  Directions are given and student has to follow given directions using items.  Ex. Following a recipe or directions to a place in the virtual community.
 
Student puts scenes in sequence, as well as writes what the scene is.  Once sequenced the program reads the cards.  Student decides if it is correct or not.

##Andrew( The Dictator) Fritsch and his group of peasants
We decided to incorporate scratch to create an assessment where the students create their own political cartoon. In history classrooms, political cartoons are part of the curriculum so it would benefit the students to still have the principle ideas and themes behind the cartoons. but now they can create their own (other than drawing one by hand). 

The students would be given the task to create their own political cartoon depending on the unit being covered at that point in time. Different historical figures could be represented by the sprites, and the conversations taking place would represent the idea and theme behind the political cartoon. The students all have different ideas about certain time periods and when they see the plain jane political cartoons that traditionally show up they might have an idea of their own how to best represent this scene or era in a different sense. Allowing the students to create their own political cartoon would be great, and even better if the teacher implements a certain number of vocabulary words they must use in their scratch! 

##From Kelly and her group
*Character Study*-
Create Sprite in Scratch (outer traits)
Use trait to create dialog and action for the Sprite (inner traits)
Game- Other kids guess the trait word, predict behavior, add dialog, costumes, etc. 

*Math - Comparing Numbers*
Create scale
Generate random numbers for each side.
Enter answer
Scale moves to reflect greater number
Extend: time on analog clock, before and after, enter number needed to make balance, mass

##From Keith and TJ
Here is the list of Scratch ideas from T.J. and me

*Greater than, Less than
Story - Create/Recreate
Time
Money - Change back, counting by denomination/value
Fractions
Family Tree
Addition/Subtraction
Life Cycle
Photosynthesis
Character Traits
Simple Machines*

##From Charlie and his group (Charlie, Kesiah, Karla, Tracy)
*Animated concepts:* 
- Show the different cycles:
	+ Water Cycle
	+ Carbon Cycle
	+ Nitrogen Cycle
	+ Star life cycle
	+ Rock Cycle
- Show the process of photosynthesis. 
- Flow of energy through a food web
- Different ways of heat transfer (radiation, convection, conduction)
- Phase changes (solid, liquid, gas)
- Physical and chemical reactions
- Response and stimuli 

*Vocabulary:*
- Give students a different vocabulary word and have them explain the definition using Scratch
- Have different students explain a vocabulary word in a cycle and have them all present in order of the cycle

*Reinforcement Tools (games/quizzes)*
