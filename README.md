Inventing-and-Making-in-the-Classroom
=====================================

A place to store stuff for our course this summer at Pace University

This course is all about bringing Inventing and Making into classrooms. Our experience, and lots of research, tell us that building things of all types -- whether software or games or posters or robots or clothes -- puts us directly into the world of learning. 

In this course, we will work with a number of tools that provide opportunities for our students to make things:
- Scratch (http://scratch.mmit.edu)
- LEGO Robotics 
- Arduino (http://arduino.cc) microprocessors (which will use to drive motors and sensors to make interactive objects of various kinds)
- 3D Printing (http://printrbot.com/simple)

Each step of the way, we will ask ourselves how these tools can be used to provide opportunites for learning for our students.


Welcome aboard!
